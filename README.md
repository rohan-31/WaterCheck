WaterCheck

WaterCheck is a program that uses linear regression to predict the potability of a sample of water.

The dataset used can be found on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability


Increasing usage of water is stressing resources worldwide, and a seemingly endless list of contaminants can turn once potable water into a health hazard.

Moreover, potable water may seem like a luxury in the years to come, if necessary precautions and steps are not taken.

This provided me with a push in the direction of making something, however insignificant, that may help us understand an environmental hazard which is largely ignored.



Through this application, I aim to analyse a few samples of water, 
test for potential potability and verify with the given values.



I used python tools in a jupyter notebook to create a linear regression model, that can help predict the potability of samples of water, given other information in a tabular form.
 
Using HTML and CSS, I created a landing page with a link to my GitHub repo, containing the code.



As a beginner, I had very basic knowledge of any of the tools I have mentioned., so it was initially very challenging to convert the idea into a usable program. Also, I was rather pressed for time, so I was unable to create a user interface to better interact with the model.

I am currently using the Flask API to create a better user interface and improve the usability of the model.
